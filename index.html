            <h2>Here are 5 lifestyle choices that – when adopted – can help protect and restore our oceans for future generations.</h2>

            <h3>1. DEMAND PLASTIC-FREE ALTERNATIVES</h3>
            <h4>The oceans face a massive and growing threat from plastics. An estimated 17.6 billion pounds of plastic leaks into the marine environment from land-based sources every year—that’s roughly equivalent to dumping a garbage truck full of plastic into our oceans every minute. And plastics never go away</h4>

            <h3>2. REDUCE YOUR CARBON FOOTPRINT</h3>
            <h4>Carbon dioxide, a known greenhouse gas, is making our oceans more acidic. This is contributing to the loss of corals on a global scale as their calcium skeletons are weakened by the increasing acidity of the water. You can reduce your carbon footprint by adopting some of these simple measures:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>Ride a bike, walk or use public transportation rather than driving a car.</li>
                <li>Turn off the lights when you leave a room.</li>
                <li>Put on a sweater in the winter instead of turning up your thermostat.</li>
                <li>Have some fun with your diet – buy sustainably caught wild seafood. It is a renewable resource that requires minimal freshwater to produce and emits less carbon dioxide than land-based proteins like beef.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h3>3. AVOID OCEAN-HARMING PRODUCTS</h3>
            <h4>There are many products directly linked to harming endangered or threatened species, unsustainable fishing methods and pollution. For example, avoid cosmetics that contain shark squalene, jewelry made of coral or sea turtle shell, souvenir shells of conchs, nautiluses and other animals, and single-use plastics like straws and water bottles that can end up in our oceans. These products support unsustainable fishing and threaten important species and ecosystems.</h4>

            <h3>4. EAT SUSTAINABLE SEAFOOD</h3>
            <h4>Choose seafood that is healthy for you and the oceans from well-managed, wild fisheries.</h4>
            <p>It might be difficult to understand which seafood you should eat, so watch this <a href="https://youtu.be/4wBe9UiTMaA">video</a></p>

            <h3>5. VOTE ON OCEAN ISSUES</h3>
            <h4>Electing public officials that support good ocean policies can help us protect marine life and our oceans. Do your research on candidates and make an informed decision, then exercise your right (and responsibility) to vote. And don’t let Election Day be the last time they hear from you. Follow up with your candidates and elected officials regularly to remind them of policies you care about.</h4>
